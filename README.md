HI Sharov, 

Here is the step that you need to follow in order to run this program, 

First thing, need to git clone both repositories (mad-backend and mad-frontend)

`https://github.com/madsukaa/mad-backend.git` and `https://github.com/madsukaa/mad-frontend.git`

Once you're done, open terminal (powershell or any other terminal), goto mad-frontend repository in your local 

and run `npm install`

For the next part, since this project is using **MySQL**, so kinda need to install **XAMPP** to setup the **SQL**. Once finish, can start run MySQL and Apache Web Server.

You have to create one db, you can naming it whatever you want, but dont forget to configure in `application.properties` in mad-backend repo.

When all setting is done, you can start run the backend first, once started, go to frontend, can open in any IDE, I use VSCODE, 

and run `npm run dev`. Then, you're done! you can start explore my mini project. 

Code : ReactJS + Spring Boot 
IDE : VSCode
DB : MySQL
